# The Question
Answer the following exam question and at the end back all your explanations with searchable references:
A company is migrating its database servers from Amazon EC2 instances that run Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server DB instances. The company's analytics team must export large data elements every day until the migration is complete. The data elements are the result of SQL joins across multiple tables. The data must be in Apache Parquet format. The analytics team must store the data in Amazon S3.
Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?

A. Create a view in the EC2 instance-based SQL Server databases that contains the required data elements. Create an AWS Glue job that selects the data directly from the view and transfers the data in Parquet format to an S3 bucket. Schedule the AWS Glue job to run every day.
B. Schedule SQL Server Agent to run a daily SQL query that selects the desired data elements from the EC2 instance-based SQL Server databases. Configure the query to direct the output .csv objects to an S3 bucket. Create an S3 event that invokes an AWS Lambda function to transform the output format from .csv to Parquet.
C. Use a SQL query to create a view in the EC2 instance-based SQL Server databases that contains the required data elements. Create and run an AWS Glue crawler to read the view. Create an AWS Glue job that retrieves the data and transfers the data in Parquet format to an S3 bucket. Schedule the AWS Glue job to run every day.
D. Create an AWS Lambda function that queries the EC2 instance-based databases by using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). Configure the Lambda function to retrieve the required data, transform the data into Parquet format, and transfer the data into an S3 bucket. Use Amazon EventBridge to schedule the Lambda function to run every day.

To determine the most operationally efficient solution for exporting large data elements from Microsoft SQL Server databases on Amazon EC2 to Amazon S3 in Apache Parquet format, we need to consider the capabilities and integration of AWS services, as well as the ease of automation and maintenance.

**Option A:**
- **Explanation:** This option suggests creating a view in the SQL Server databases and using an AWS Glue job to select data from the view and transfer it to S3 in Parquet format. AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service that can efficiently handle data transformation and loading tasks. By using a view, the complexity of SQL joins is abstracted, making the Glue job simpler. Scheduling the Glue job to run daily automates the process.
- **Operational Efficiency:** AWS Glue is designed for such ETL tasks and can handle large data volumes efficiently. It also natively supports writing data in Parquet format.
- **References:** 
  - AWS Glue: [AWS Glue Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/what-is-glue.html)
  - Parquet format support: [AWS Glue Supported Formats](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-format.html)

**Option B:**
- **Explanation:** This option involves using SQL Server Agent to export data to CSV format and then using an S3 event to trigger a Lambda function to convert CSV to Parquet. This introduces additional steps and dependencies, such as managing CSV files and ensuring the Lambda function can handle the conversion efficiently.
- **Operational Efficiency:** This approach is less efficient due to the intermediate CSV format and the need for a separate conversion step, which can be error-prone and resource-intensive.
- **References:** 
  - SQL Server Agent: [SQL Server Agent Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/agent/sql-server-agent?view=sql-server-ver15)
  - AWS Lambda: [AWS Lambda Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)

**Option C:**
- **Explanation:** Similar to Option A, this option uses a view and AWS Glue but adds a Glue crawler to read the view. The Glue job then transfers the data to S3 in Parquet format. The crawler is used to infer the schema, which might not be necessary if the schema is already known.
- **Operational Efficiency:** While efficient, the use of a crawler adds an unnecessary step if the schema is static, slightly reducing operational efficiency compared to Option A.
- **References:** 
  - AWS Glue Crawler: [AWS Glue Crawlers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-crawler.html)

**Option D:**
- **Explanation:** This option involves using a Lambda function with JDBC to query the databases, transform the data to Parquet, and store it in S3. While Lambda can be used for such tasks, it is not ideal for handling large data volumes due to its execution time and memory limits.
- **Operational Efficiency:** This approach is less efficient for large datasets due to Lambda's limitations and the complexity of handling JDBC connections and Parquet transformations within Lambda.
- **References:** 
  - AWS Lambda Limits: [AWS Lambda Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html)

**Conclusion:**
Option A is the most operationally efficient solution. It leverages AWS Glue's capabilities to handle large data volumes and perform the necessary transformations directly to Parquet format, minimizing intermediate steps and manual interventions. AWS Glue's integration with S3 and its ability to schedule jobs make it well-suited for this task.

**Selected Option:** A
