# LLM Data Engineer
This repository is dedicated to research and education of evaluating and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in the discipline of data engineering.

Data engineering serves as the foundation for all data science initiatives, including projects involving LLMs. It encompasses the design and implementation of systems to collect, store, and process data through ETL pipelines, ensuring accessibility and integrity throughout the analytical lifecycle (Jain). 

Data engineering is complex and time-consuming, involving the meticulous design, deployment and maintenance of data pipelines, ETL processes, and storage solutions. It requires expertise in handling vast datasets, ensuring data quality, and integrating tools, all while addressing scalability, security, and performance challenges to support efficient data science workflows. 

Transforming industries through their advanced capabilities, LLMs are reshaping fields such as healthcare, finance, and education. From powering personalized tutoring systems to enhancing diagnostic tools with natural language understanding, LLMs streamline workflows, improve accessibility, and generate innovative solutions. Their adaptability continues to redefine the potential of AI applications. 

This momentum has also driven transformative research aimed at redefining data science, the field from which LLMs emerged. Researchers are investigating how LLMs can not only enhance traditional data analysis and predictive modeling but also address practical challenges associated with integrating LLMs into data science workflows. 

The limited research on data engineering has inspired this study, which seeks to evaluate how well LLMs, without fine-tuning, understand data engineering concepts and perform practical tasks in real-world scenarios. In a rapidly evolving field, this work aims to provide valuable insights for data engineering professionals—typically early adopters of new technologies —on the impact of LLMs on their careers and future development.
